# Extended Experience Details

## Self-employed (Quixel, Epic & MG)

"What if we just made the peg rounder?"

At Machinegames, I leveraged my experience in audio production pipelines, choosing the Qt framework to create user-facing asset management tools. I successfully built a bridge (in Python!) between Reaper (audio software) and the Wwise audio engine for use by sound designers to iterate on thousands of audio assets.

At Quixel, I was tasked with building and maintaining a performant and browser-compliant set of React design system components, as well as being part of daily UI/UX work with senior designers.

For my stint at Epic Games, I leveraged this experience in building a company-wide React implementation of a new design system that put a premium on user experience and accessibility. As part of the team, I wrote, reviewed and championed code using future-facing technologies and test-driven development practices to avoid ending up in maintenance hell. At the end of my stint, we had a full complement of performant, accessible and long-term viable components.

## Favro

"Can a meteor actually rise?"

Having identified that web-based tools with native-like capabilities were finally viable, I was part of establishing the "Hansoft X" team that would subsequently spin off into the startup Favro. I was comfortably working with forward-looking web technologies (we were early adopters of TypeScript) and shouldered the primary front-end development responsibilities, ensuring a performant and browser-compatible codebase that ran on desktop and mobile platforms.

As frontend development and UI/UX became my chief responsibility, I did the majority of all user research, looping insights back into ongoing development. At the time of my departure, Favro was an ambitious attempt at building a radically simplified project collaboration user experience.

## Hansoft

"We might need an icon for that..."

I maintained a relationship with the developers, ultimately joining up with them to work on making the UI more approachable for the broader demographic. The evolution of Hansoft coinciding with the rise of Agile development practices, I was part of a substantial pivot as well as a multi-platform rollout of a high-performing native application ported to the Qt UI framework. I also shouldered sound, music and video production responsibilities, as well as facilitating the web development work.

As I traveled to speak to current and potential users, I identified the need for radical UI/UX improvements in order to build competitive project management software. This sparked the decision to write a web-based prototype that would eventually become Favro.

## Starbreeze

"You only ship once!"

I ran the internal sound department and produced sound, voices and music for the seven games we shipped until 2012. As the company grew to 200 employees with multiple productions running in parallel, I dedicated significant time to maintaining the audio pipeline to satisfy the ever-growing complexity and demands on asset throughput.

At the time of my departure in 2012, I was leading an audio team of seven people while also maintaining the audio pipeline, developing tools to make our jobs less cognitively taxing and error-prone.

## O3 Games

"I bet we'll be done in nine months."

In 1997, I was one of the founders of a small games studio. One of eight full-time developers, I was responsible for all sound, voices and music in the game, as well as video production and localization. The studio soon grew to 30 people, and we secured funding to acquire Starbreeze Studios and their in-house game engine.
